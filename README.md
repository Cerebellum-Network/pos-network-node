# Cere Node with PoS consensus

## How to become a validator

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/validator-instructions#how-to-become-a-validator) to get the Node up and running.

## License

## Build the node

1. [Install `Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Run the following command to update submodules.

```
 git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Run the following command to build the node.

```
 docker build .
```

## Run tests

1. [Install `Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Run the following command run tests.

```
 docker build --build-arg ECR_REGISTRY=$ECR_REGISTRY -f Dockerfile.tests -t pos-network-node:test .
```

3. Run the following command to copy SC artifacts to test_data folder.

```
id=$(docker create $ECR_REGISTRY/crb-smart-contracts:$SMART_CONTRACT_VERSION)
docker cp $id::/smart-contracts/artifacts/ ./artifacts/
docker rm -v $id
```

## Versioning strategy

The package must follow **Semantic Versioning** (SemVer).
This strategy provides information on the type of changes introduced in a given version, compared to the previous one, in a unified format that automated tools can use.

The version is expressed as **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**.

- MAJOR introduces one or more breaking changes.
- MINOR introduces one or more backwards-compatible API changes.
- PATCH only introduces bug fixes with no API changes.

For more information, see "[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)".

## Development
We use `rustfmt` for the code formatting.
[How to install](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt#on-the-nightly-toolchain)
In order to format code in the specific directory, run:
```
cargo +nightly fmt
```
